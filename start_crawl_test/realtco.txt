BUT YOU DON’T HAVE TO TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT.
According to these nine Advisors in The Oracles, who made millions by investing in real estate, it’s still the best way to build wealth. Read more at CNBC.com >
Permissionless, compliant, and first-of-its-kind
RealToken provides investors with a simple, intelligent, and user-friendly method to buy into fractional, tokenized properties, leveraging the U.S. legal system and the permissionless, unrestricted token issuance of Ethereum.
Investing with RealT means low maintenance property ownership, access to cash flows related to the property (e.g., rent), and frictionless ownership transactions via RealTokens.
Unique Tokens
Ownership of each property is distributed across a finite number of representative tokens. Based on token share, owners can collect revenue from rent, and vote on property decisions.
Property Managed
Each RealT property has a property management company managing the property on RealToken owners behalf. The property management company sources tenants, collects rent, and manages repairs, so the diverse group of RealToken owners don’t have to.
INC/LLC Owned
Real estate can’t directly be tokenized, but legal entities can. Each property is owned by company (either an Inc or an LLC). Each company is tokenized as a unique set of RealTokens and made available for purchase.
Weekly Rent Payments
With blockchains, we no longer need to wait 30 days to receive a bank transfer. Owning property with RealT allows you to collect rent every week. Rent is paid using a US-Dollar stablecoin, sent to your Gnosis Chain or Ethereum wallet.

  This information is not an offer to invest in any token, Fund or other opportunity and is provided for information only. Performance results are shown net of all fees, costs, and expenses associated with the token. Should an investor choose to redeem a token through RealT or on a secondary market, other processing fees may be assessed that are not factored into the returns presented. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Returns are calculated based on the rental payments distributed throughout the year and the appreciation in value of the underlying property. The appreciation in value is based on the difference between purchase price and annual property reappraisals. Individual investor returns may vary based on the timing of their investments and redemptions.
