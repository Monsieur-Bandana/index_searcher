We searched the globe and selected Polymath to be our tokenization platform because the people are great and know what they are doing. From our first Blockchain conference, the team was extremely helpful in breaking down the process to me in a simple way, without the technical jargon you often find in blockchain. We still remain with Polymath because their innovation continues to grow with our needs. It’s awesome that I can spend my time on business development, knowing Polymath is focused on building next level technology relevant for our success.

WHY POLYMATH
Driving efficient capital markets
We relentlessly focus on the technological backbone for security tokens. Whether configuring tokens using the Polymath Token Studio or integrating our broker-dealer toolkit into your offering, Polymath’s technology brings efficiency and transparency to security token management.
Open source.
Transparency is at the core of all Polymath products.
Standardized.
ERC1400 standard ensures the token’s code meets specific requirements in order to minimize technical due diligence. Learn more ->
Modular.
Build offers your way, for your jurisdictions. Polymath modules let you customize your offering, manage your team, and provide corporate actions.
Automated.
Polymath lets issuers set rules around who can hold their token, how it can be transferred and other jurisdictional requirements. From there, the system will automate rule enforcement. 
End-to-end.
Polymath’s self-serve token creation and management technology integrates smoothly with a large ecosystem of custodians, broker-dealers, legal firms, cap table management providers, token sale platforms, KYC/AML providers and others so that issuers can create a bespoke end-to-end solution.
Purpose-built.
Polymesh is an institutional-grade blockchain built specifically for security tokens that solves the inherent challenges with public infrastructure around identity, compliance, confidentiality, and governance. Learn more ->
