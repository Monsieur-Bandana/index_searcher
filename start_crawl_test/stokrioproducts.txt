WHAT IS CROWDFUNDING AND HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM STOS?
Crowdfunding is not the same as security token offerings. The classic way to raise funds for a business is to bootstrap it via personal savings or to receive a loan from friends, family, and banks.

Crowdfunding is a form of crowdsourcing that is often used to raise capital from a large number of individuals for both for-profit and non-profit purposes.
